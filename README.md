# Skelly.io

This is the Jekyll template and repo for my blog. You should read here instead of at [skelly.io](http://skelly.io) if you prefer doing templating in your head rather than via a web interface


## TODOs:

- Add google analytics
- Add a comment section (Disqus?)
- Add inline footnotes like in whatif.xkcd.com
  - Maybe make them all appear a the side of the article when you hover?
- Think of more categories and actually write some stuff for them
- Maybe add brief descriptions under each article

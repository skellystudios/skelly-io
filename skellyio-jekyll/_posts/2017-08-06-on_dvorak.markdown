# A syllogism

**Proposition 1:**

> Dvorak seems to offer plenty of advantages unless you rely on things like having Vim keybindings in muscle-memory

**Proposition 2:**

> Everyone who switches to Dvorak is the sort of person who has Vim keybindings in muscle-memory

**Conclusion:**

> Don't Dvorak

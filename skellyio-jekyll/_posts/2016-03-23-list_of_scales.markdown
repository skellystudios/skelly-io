If you've come to this page, you're probably really eager to read the my list of the best scales of measure (in my opinion). But I urge you to be patient for a few more paragraphs and instead indulge me for a bit while I

Here's a list of my favourite scales. I've tried to loosely define a scale as

1. **[Richter Magnitude Scale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richter_Scale)** - Earthquakes

    This was the first scale I was aware of as a kid. Mainly because I loved geology. As far as I'm concerned it's the original scale.

2. **Glasgow Scale** - Actually 2 scales: [Coma]() and    [Outcome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow_Outcome_Scale)

    The guys at Glasgow University have two scales named after them. Unfortunately, they're both pretty grim. Interesting problem where even though there are definitely better options, there's no consensus.


4. **[Fujita Scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujita_scale)** - Tornado Intensity
4. Beaufort
5. Waffle House
6. Scoville
7. **[Likert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale)** - Self-reporting survey responses

    OK, so this is a bit of a meta-scale

8. Bristol
9. Mohs
10. Kinsey
11. Epworth
12. Tanner
13. Holmes and Rahe

Also, no, this page isn't a scale.

# Overview

We were engaged by The Client with difficulty fulfilling current contractual obligations. [ MORE ]

# Recommendations

### 1. Slay The Nemean Lion
Current estimate for completion of this task is 30 man-days. McKinsey recommends augmenting the client's current resource (1 man, ) with appropriate contract resource. Given sufficient time for on-boarding, team building exercises and a plenary debrief, post-mortem; we estimate that penetration could be accomplished by a team of 10 McKinsey-approved hunting consultants in under 20 days (plus expenses).


### 2. Slay the Many Headed Hydra
Industry experts warn that Hydra is on the cusp of rapid expansion, as each severed head is replaced by 2 new ones, leading to exponential, hockey-stick growth. We therefore advise the Client to continue the plan of severing all and any current cranial appendages, and re-engaging McKinsey Consulting on separate projects to consult on further cutting of any subsequent heads that may arise.

### 3. Catch the Ceryneian Hind, Which Is As fast as Wind
Attempting to catch up with established competition not advised. Instead, should do a SWOT analysis to find correct niche in market.

### 4. Catch the Erymanthian Boar
Given the religious sensitivities around the consumption of Pork by followers of many large players in the religion market, The Firm recommends that The Client should find a Halaal and Kosher alternative for this task.

### 5. Clean out the Augean Stables
An unresolved budgetary allocation dispute has meant that it is unclear whether the mandate for maintenance of the stable site lies with the Facilities Management Department or with the Sanitation Department. The firm believes that there is little chance for [ TODO ]

The Facilities Management Department of Augeas have the mandate to maintain sanitation in and around the Stables site, however due to an unresolved budgetary allocation dispute. Speak to facilities management [**talk of the corporate structure**]. Maybe reshuffle the entire facility so that HR are in the stables.

### 6. Defeat the Stymphalian Birds
As the task is only to defeat them, recommend muscling out the market

### 7. Capture the Cretan Bull
India is a massive global market, so bad to take on the bull.
OR wall street.

### 8. Capture the Flesh-eating Mares of Diomedes
Trained to eat flesh by their owner => PR nightmare on his hands

### 9. Retrieve the Belt of Hippolyta
Good chance for a merger

### 10. Obtain the Cattle of Geryon
Some sort of options market

### 11. Obtain the Apples of the Hesperides
Low hanging fruit joke

### 12. Capture Cerberus
Hades is actually another McKinsey client, so we will be happy to arrange a mutual exchange.. for a fee

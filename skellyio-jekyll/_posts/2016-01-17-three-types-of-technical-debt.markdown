Not all technical debt is the born equal

# Student Loan Debt


**What it looks like**

This is the sort of shortcuts you had to take in order to actually get anywhere. This is for being diligent and following Knuth’s urging that premature optimisation is the root of all evil.

This sort of thing takes the form

**How it gets you**



# Credit Card Debt





# Loan Shark Debt

**What it looks like**

This is the bad stuff. The really toxic stuff. The Lehman Brothers deal with the devil sort of stuff. This is when in a flurry of panic at 10pm you hard coded something like 

`today = Weekdays.Tuesday     # Definitely need to change this`


**How it gets you**

Like real loan shark debt, not paying it off in time (like before Wednesday arrives) can result in bad things happening to your system’s kneecaps. Seriously bad things. This is the sort of thing that takes your server down just before an important demo.

And just like real loan shark debt, borrowing once sinks you into a terrible spiral, where you have to borrow again to pay off the first one.
